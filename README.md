# fxconverter

Demo app demonstrating how to consume and cache data from REST API's in android with Retofit, Moshi, Coroutines, LiveData, Flows and Jetpacks (Room, ViewModel).
FxConverter provides exchange rate information for various currencies around the world (over 100 currencies) it also lets you calculate the exchange value between two currencies.
### This could be implemented as a feature in a larger project.
